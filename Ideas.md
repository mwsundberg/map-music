Loop based audio generated by drawing on elevation map
	Use Directions API for using roads to get elevation as alternative input

Drawing mode, panning mode
	Draw in transparent canvas
	Pass data through L.containerPointToLatLng(<Point> point) to the map
	
   Use map.dragging.disable when we are drawing on canvas
   
   
## Mapping Elevation to Pitch
Main idea: lower elevation = lower pitch, higher elevation = higher pitch

Elevation info will be normalized on a per-line basis, let's say in the range of 0-100. 
So we will take this 0-100 number and map it onto the musical scale between C1 and C6
(midi 24-84). 


## Tools/Effects

- pitch: elevation maps to pitch and generates music (see above)
- volume: elevation maps to volume levels (easy mapping 0-100%) and modifies existing track
- pitch warp: elevation maps to pitch warp factor (similar as above) and modifies existing track
- CA$H MONEY: fun UI to determine how much money to bank transfer!

## Install
1. `npm install -g browserify` (one time)
1. `npm install` (one time/when dependencies are added)
1. `./browserify-build.sh` (every time you change the JS)
